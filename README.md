# Automatic Teller Machine using _Java_ and _MySQL_

### A fully functional Java project that was designed and built to replicate the basic features of a standardized ATM.
### You can create your own bank account through the _Signup_ button and log into your account using the card number that's given to you at the end of the signup process.
### Once you log in successfully, you will be given 6 options: _Deposit_, _Withdrawal_, _Fast Cash_, _Mini Statement_, _Bank Inquiry_, and _Pinchange_. Click on your desired option and input any needed details. 
### For all of the options, you can use the back button to come back to the _transactions_ page if you misclicked or do not want that specific service.
### All information is stored and organized in a local _MySQL_ database and can be accessed at any time.

## How to Install and Run: 
### 1. Download the zip file by clicking on the green **CODE** button
